# ICPC Team Details

This project contains two Python scripts for retrieving and displaying details of ICPC teams. The first script, icpc.py, is a terminal-based script that prompts the user for a team ID and displays the corresponding team name and member names in the terminal. The second script, icpc\_gui.py, is a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the script that allows the user to input the team ID in a text box and displays the team details in a window.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the setup.sh script from the command line:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## Usage

To run the terminal-based script, use the following command:

```bash
python icpc.py
```

In both cases, enter the team ID when prompted and press enter to display the team details.

## Requirements

The following libraries are required for this project:

- penpyxl
- tkinter

These libraries are automatically installed when running the setup.sh script.
